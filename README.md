# Portfolio Project Using NuxtJS and TailwindCSS
 
This was a personal project to learn and practice NuxtJS, Vue3 Composition API, and TailwindCSS.

The aim of the project was to develop a personal portfolio to showcase my work and experience - available at https://www.rachel-kirby.com (deployed with Heroku)

For simplicity, based on the scope of this project, I utilised JSON to manage the data rather than implementing and hosting a database.
